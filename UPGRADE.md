# Migration Guide

## Upgrading from v7.x → v8.0

Our version 8 release includes many significant improvements:

- Adoption of [modern PHP language features](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-74) including typed properties, null coalescing assignment operators, and array spreading.
- Support for custom [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) and [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) factories for customizing network requests. [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) responses are also now returned throughout the SDK.
- [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) event hooks are now supported throughout the SDK.
- [Fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface#PHP) throughout the SDK, offering simplified usage.
- Optional auto-pagination of Management API endpoints that support pagination.
- [PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/call-your-api-using-the-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) is now enabled by default.
- Improved JWT processing and fewer dependencies.

As is to be expected with a major release, there are breaking changes in this update. Please ensure you read this guide thoroughly and prepare your app before upgrading to SDK v8.

### New minimum PHP version: 7.4 (8.0 preferred)

- SDK v8.0 requires PHP 7.4 or higher. PHP 8.0 is supported, and its use with this library is preferred and strongly encouraged.
- 7.4 will be the final release in PHP's 7.x branch. This SDK will only support PHP 8.0+ after 7.4 leaves [supported status](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) in November 2022.
- We strongly encourage you to make use of PHP 8.0's new [named arguments language feature](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-8-named-arguments). Once 7.4 support ends, we will no longer consider method argument order changes to be a breaking change.

### Session Storage Chan ges Require User Reauthentication

The new default session storage medium in 8.0 are encrypted cookies. Upgrading to 8.0 from 7.x will require your application's users to re-authenticate.

### Class and Method Changes

### Potentially Breaking Changes

These classes were updated in SDK 8.0:

- Class `Auth0\SDK\Auth0` updated:

  - `__construct` updated:
    - `configuration` added as a required instance of either an `SdkConfiguration` class, or an array of configuration options. See the [8.0 configuration](#configuring-auth0-sdk-80) and [8.0 configuration options](#updated-configuration-options) guides for usage information.
    - All other arguments have been removed.
  - Public method `authentication()` added. It returns a pre-configured singleton of the `Auth0\SDK\API\Authentication` class.
  - Public method `management()` added. It returns a pre-configured singleton of the `Auth0\SDK\API\Management` class.
  - Public method `login()` updated:
    - Method now accepts an argument, `params`: an array of parameters to pass with the API request.
    - Arguments `state`, `connection`, and `additionalParameters` have been removed. Use the new `params` argument for these uses.
    - Method now returns an intended login URL as a string. Method no longer sends redirect headers itself to better integrate with application frameworks. Developers should redirect users to the returned URL using a method appropriate for the application type/framework. For example, the redirect() method in Laravel or Symfony, Header("Location: $url") with plain PHP, etc.
  - Public method `signup()` added as a convenience. This method will pass the ?screen_hint=signup param, supported by the New Universal Login Experience.
  - Public method `getLoginUrl()` moved to `Auth0\SDK\API\Authentication\getLoginLink()`, and:
    - Argument `params` is now a nullable array.
  - Public method `renewTokens()` renamed to `renew()`, and:
    - Argument `options` renamed to `params` and is now a nullable array.
  - Public method `decodeIdToken()` renamed to `decode()`, and:
    - Argument `idToken` renamed to `token.`
    - Argument `verifierOptions` removed.
    - Arguments `tokenAudience` and `tokenOrganization` added as optional, nullable arrays.
    - Argument `tokenNonce` added as an optional string.
    - Arguments `tokenMaxAge`, `tokenLeeway`, and `tokenNow` were added as optional, nullable integers.
    - Now returns an instance of `Auth0\SDK\Token` instead of an array.
  - Public methods `getAuthorizationCode()` and `getState()` were removed; please use `getRequestParameter()` method.
  - Public method `deleteAllPersistentData()` renamed to `clear()`.
  - Public methods `getNonce()` and `urlSafeBase64Decode()` were removed.
  - Public methods `getAccessTokenExpiration()` and `setAccessTokenExpiration()` were added for retrieving for storing an access token expiration timestamp in session storage, respectively.
  - Public methods `getUser()`, `getAccessToken()`, `getIdToken()` and `getRefreshToken()` no longer implicitly invoke `exchange()` as was previously the case, and instead return only what is already available in an available session. This change was made to avoid unintentionally invoking the token exchange at inappropriate times, and to allow developers to more easily check for an available session without accidentally executing unwanted code. Developers will need to call `Auth0::exchange()` themselves when a code exchange is desired to establish a session and store user data, which will then be available for return from the beforementioned methods.
  - Public method `getCredentials()` added as a convenience. This method returns the Id Token, Access Token, Refresh Token, Access Token expiration timestamp, and user data from an available session without invoking an authorization flow, exchange, or raising an error if a session is not available.

- Class `Auth0\SDK\API\Authentication` updated:

  - `__construct` updated:
    - `configuration` added as a required instance of either an `SdkConfiguration` class, or an array of configuration options. See the [8.0 configuration](#configuring-auth0-sdk-80) and [8.0 configuration options](#updated-configuration-options) guides for usage information.
    - All other arguments have been removed.
  - Public method 'getHttpClient()' added.
  - Public method `get_authorize_link()` renamed to `getLoginLink()`, and:
    - Method now accepts an argument, `params`: an array of parameters to pass with the request. Please see the API endpoint documentation for available options. Note also the previously optional `state` argument is now required.

### Configuring Auth0 SDK 8.0

Most class constructors throughout the SDK accept a new `SdkConfiguration` configuration class, which shares your app configuration by reference throughout the SDK's subclasses, allowing you to make changes on the fly from within your app:

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;

// PHP 8.0 named arguments syntax
$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    domain: 'your-tenant.auth0.com',
    clientId: 'application_client_id',
    clientSecret: 'application_client_secret',
    redirectUri: 'https://yourapplication.com/auth/callback',
    tokenAlgorithm: 'RS256'
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

Alternatively, you can use an array to configure the base `Auth0` class, and a `SdkConfiguration` will instantiate for you. Key names must match the same camelCase format of the constructor arguments for `SdkConfiguration.`

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;

// PHP 7.4-compatible array syntax
$auth0 = new Auth0([
    'domain' => 'your-tenant.auth0.com',
    'clientId' => 'application_client_id',
    'clientSecret' => 'application_client_secret',
    'redirectUri' => 'https://yourapplication.com/auth/callback',
    'tokenAlgorithm' => 'HS256'
]);
```

After initializing the Auth0 SDK with your configuration, you can keep a reference to the `SdkConfiguration` within your app so you can make changes later. The SDK automatically recognizes changes to your `SdkConfiguration` and uses them.

```PHP
$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    domain: 'your-tenant.auth0.com',
    clientId: 'application_client_id',
    clientSecret: 'application_client_secret',
    redirectUri: 'https://yourapplication.com/auth/callback',
    tokenAlgorithm: 'RS256'
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);

// Prints 'your-tenant.auth0.com'
echo $configuration->getDomain();

// Change the configuration
$configuration->setDomain('another-tenant.auth0.com');

// Prints 'another-tenant.auth0.com'
echo $configuration->getDomain();

// Will authenticate the user with 'another-tenant.auth0.com'
$auth->login();
```

### Updated Configuration Options

Some options names have changed for clarity. It would be best to reference the `SdkConfiguration` constructor comments for an up-to-date list, as there may be new additions with later releases. At the time of this guide's writing, these options are available:

```text
$strategy              string|null                    Defaults to 'webapp'. Should be assigned either 'api', 'management', or 'webapp' to specify the type of application the SDK is being applied to. Determines what configuration options will be required at initialization.

### Using the new Authentication and Management Factories

SDK v8.0 offers a cleaner approach of accessing the Authentication and Management API sub-classes without having to reconfigure them independently: configure the base `Auth0` class, and use the factory methods to configure these API sub-classes for you:

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;

// Configure just once:
$auth0 = new Auth0([
    'domain' => 'your-tenant.auth0.com',
    'clientId' => 'application_client_id',
    'clientSecret' => 'application_client_secret',
    'redirectUri' => 'https://yourapplication.com/auth/callback',
    'tokenAlgorithm' => 'HS256'
]);

// Returns an instance already configured for you.
$authentication = $auth0->authentication();
$management = $auth0->management();

// Or, a fluent example:
$response = $auth0->management()->users()->getAll();
```

### Support for PSR-18 and PSR-17 factories

Previous versions of the Auth0 PHP SDK had a dependency on [Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org/) for issuing network requests. SDK v8.0 uses a more modern approach of accepting developer-supplied [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) and [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) factory interfaces for making these requests. We strongly encourage you to pass the factories of your choice during SDK configuration. The SDK will make a best-effort attempt at auto-discovering any compatible libraries present in your application when none are specified.

As an example, let's say your application is already incorporating [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz) and [Nylom's PSR-7 implementation](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7), which include PSR-18 and PSR-17 factories, respectively. Pass these to the SDK to use them:

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;
use Buzz\Client\MultiCurl;
use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;

// PSR-17 HTTP Factory (creates http requests and responses)
$httpFactory = new Psr17Factory();

 // PSR-18 HTTP Client (delivers http requests created by the PSR-17 factory above)
$httpClient = new MultiCurl($httpFactory);

$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    domain: 'your-tenant.auth0.com',
    clientId: 'application_client_id',
    redirectUri: 'https://yourapplication.com/auth/callback',

    // Specify a PSR-18 HTTP client factory:
    httpClient: $httpClient

    // Specify PSR-17 request/response factories:
    httpRequestFactory: $httpFactory
    httpResponseFactory: $httpFactory
    httpStreamFactory: $httpFactory
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

The libraries specified above are simply examples. Any libraries that support the PSR-18 and PSR-17 standards will work.

### Support for PSR-7 responses

Most functions that issue network requests now return [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) message interfaces, which allow you a greater deal of control over handling the response, such as troubleshooting errors and analyzing headers. We've included a utility class for simplifying working with these responses in general use cases:

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;

$auth0 = new Auth0(/* ...configuration */);

// Get all users via fluent interface
$response = $auth0->management()->users()->getAll();

if (HttpResponse::wasSuccessful($response)) { // Checks that the status code was 200
    $users = HttpResponse::decodeContent($response); // Parses the response body as JSON and returns the resulting object
    print_r($users);

    $headers = HttpResponse::getHeaders($response); // Get an array containing all the headers attached to the response.
    print_r($headers);
}
```

Alternatively, you can achieve the same results with the native PSR-7 standard API without using the `HttpResponse` utility class:

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;

$auth0 = new Auth0(/* ...configuration */);

// Get all users via fluent interface
$response = $auth0->management()->users()->getAll();

if ($response->getStatusCode() === 200) { // Checks that the status code was 200
    print_r(json_decode($response->getBody()->__toString(), true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR)); // Print the parsed JSON response body
    print_r($response->getHeaders()); // Print the array containing all the headers attached to the response.
}
```

### Using the new field filtering and pagination API

A new argument has been added to most network endpoints, accepting a new `RequestOptions` class type. `RequestOptions` allows you to specify field-filtered and paginated requests easily:

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\Request\{RequestOptions, FilteredRequest, PaginatedRequest};

$auth0 = new Auth0(/* ...configuration */);

// Fluent example:
$response = $auth0->management()->users()->getAll(
    request: new RequestOptions(
        fields: new FilteredRequest(
            fields: ['user_id', 'email'],
            includeFields: true
        ),
        pagination: new PaginatedRequest(
            page: 0,
            perPage: 50,
            includeTotals: true
        )
    )
);
```

↗ [Learn more about paginating Auth0 API endpoints here.](https://auth0.com/docs/api#pagination).

### Auto-pagination support available

You can use the new `HttpResponsePaginator` utility class with endpoints that support pagination to return a PHP-native iterator type, which will automatically request new pages of results as you loop through it.

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\Request\{RequestOptions, FilteredRequest, PaginatedRequest};

$auth0 = new Auth0(/* ...configuration */);

// NOTE: Auto-pagination will only work when include_totals is enabled:
$response = $auth0->management()->users()->getAll(
    request: new RequestOptions(
        pagination: new PaginatedRequest(
            page: 0,
            perPage: 50,
            includeTotals: true
        )
    )
);

// Return an HttpResponsePaginator pre-configured with our request above:
$users = $auth0->management()->getResponsePaginator();

// Count will use the total results available as reported from the API rather than what is loaded into memory.
echo 'There are ' . count($users) . ' results available from the API.';

// Our new iterator will make new, paginated network requests as necessary to retrieve more results:
foreach ($users as $user) {
    print_r($user);
}

// You can find out how many network requests were made with this helper method:
echo 'We made ' . $users->countNetworkRequests() . ' paginated network requests.';
```

⚠️ Note that SDK 8.0's `HttpResponsePaginator` does not currently support checkpoint pagination. This will be introduced in a later release.

### Using the new `Auth0::getCredentials()` method to retrieve session credentials

`Auth0::getCredentials` is a new convenience function that returns the available Id Token, Access Token, Access Token expiration timestamp, and Refresh Token (if one is available) when they are available from session storage. It also returns an `accessTokenExpired` bool value that you can more easily compare to decide if you need to renew or prompt to log back in.

```PHP
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;

$sdk = new Auth0(/* ... configuration */);

// If we've just returned from the callback, remove the ?code parameter from the query by redirecting to index route.
if ($sdk->getRequestParameter('code')) {
    header("Location: /");
    exit;
}

// Use the new helper to silently get state.
$credentials = $sdk->getCredentials();

// If there's no session, begin authentication flow. Alternatively you could render the app in guest mode, or offer a login interstitial, etc.
if (! $credentials) {
   $sdk->login();
}

// We have a session available.
if ($credentials) {
    // If the access token has expired, try to renew it.
    if ($credentials->accessTokenExpired) {
        try {
            $sdk->renew();
        } catch (\Auth0\SDK\Exception\StateException $exception) {
            // Couldn't renew the token, we might not have one based on our requested scopes. Let's fallback to starting a fresh authentication flow.
            $sdk->login();
        }
    }

    // Everything is good. Let's echo info about the user as an example.
    print_r($credentials->user);
}
```

This saves you from needing to call `Auth0::getIdToken()`, `Auth0::getUser()`, `Auth0::getAccessToken()`, `Auth0::getRefreshToken()`, and `Auth0::getAccessTokenExpiration()` separately if you simply want to inspect credentials. `Auth0::getCredentials()` will not throw an error if credentials aren't available, it will simply return a null value.

## Upgrading from v5.x → v7.x

The v7 major release adds some new features, removes several deprecated methods and classes, and changes how some applications need to be configured. Please read through this guide to make sure your application is up to date before upgrading to v7.

Only potentially breaking changes are covered in this guide. For a list of all changes for this major, see [the 7.0.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A7.0.0).

### New minimum PHP version: 7.1

The v7 release requires PHP 7.1 or later to enable a number of helpful features like type hinting and null coalescing.

### Auth0 class configuration changes

A number of breaking changes were made to the `Auth0` class configuration passed in at initialization.

The main breaking change is only for applications that accept HS256 ID tokens. If your application is set to accept ID tokens signed using the HS256 algorithm, we recommend changing that to `RS256` in the Auth0 Application > Settings tab > Advanced settings > OAuth tab > JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm field before upgrading and leaving the `id_token_alg` configuration key unset. If your application cannot be changed for some reason, set the `id_token_alg` configuration key to `HS256`, like so:

```PHP
$auth0 = new Auth0([
    'domain' => 'your-tenant.auth0.com',
    'client_id' => 'application_client_id',
    'client_secret' => 'application_client_secret',
    'redirect_uri' => 'https://yourapplication.com/auth/callback',
    'id_token_alg' => 'HS256'
]);
```

The `id_token_aud` and `id_token_iss` configuration keys have been removed, and their values will now be ignored.

The `state_handler` configuration key has been removed, and the `transient_store` configuration key has been added. See the **State and nonce handling** section below for more information about the changes with state handling.

The ability to pass `false` in the `store` configuration key has been removed. Set `store` to an instance of `EmptyStore` or set all `persist_*` configuration keys to `false` to skip all persistence.

The `cache_handler` configuration key must now be an instance of `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface.` See the **Cache handling** section below for more information.

The default `secret_base64_encoded` value is now `false` and is no longer stored in a property.

The `client_secret` configuration key is no longer required for class initialization (but will throw an exception in certain methods when required). If `secret_base64_encoded` is set to `true` then then the `clientSecret` property will now contain the decoded secret. If your application is using an encoded secret, this encoding can be turned off by rotating the client secret in the Auth0 Application settings.

The `session_cookie_expires` configuration key has been removed. The session cookie expiration should be managed in the application. If you were using this setting before, [see the PHP core function session_set_cookie_params()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-cookie-params.php) to set this value after upgrading.

The `session_base_name` configuration key has been removed. Instead, pass an instance of `StoreInterface` in the `store` configuration key with the modified name.

The `skip_userinfo` configuration key now defaults to `true.` This means that the persisted user identity will now come from the ID token rather than a call to the userinfo endpoint. This can be set to `false` to return to the behavior in v5.

The ENV variables `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI` will now be used automatically for the `domain`, `client_id,` and `redirect_uri` configuration keys, respectively.

The `debug` configuration key was removed.

### Cache handling

Cache handling has been changed in v7 to conform to the PSR-16 standard (see the discussion [here](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/issues/282)). Objects passed to the `cache_handler` configuration key in `Auth0,` and the first parameter of the `JWKFetcher` class should be instances of `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface.`

### State and nonce handling

The handling for transient authentication data, such as `state` and `nonce,` has been changed.

In an effort to enforce security standards set forth in the OAuth and OpenID Connect specifications, `state` checking on the callback route and `nonce` checking for all received ID tokens is now mandatory. Applications that require IdP-initiated sign-on should add a login route that uses `Auth0->getLoginUrl()` to redirect through Auth0 with valid state and nonce values. The URL to this route should be saved to the **Application Login URI** field in your Auth0 Application to assist with this scenario.

The handling for these values was changed from PHP session-stored values to cookies using the new `CookieStore` class. This was done, so PHP session usage was not required and to assist with applications using a `form_post` response mode. This change may require server-level white-listing of cookie names (`auth0__nonce` and `auth0__state` by default) on some managed hosts. The `transient_store` configuration key in the `Auth0` class can be used to switch back to PHP sessions or provide another method.

The default state key was changed from `auth0__webauth_state` to `auth0__state`.

### Classes and Interfaces removed

The following classes were removed in v7:

- Class `Firebase\JWT\JWT` provided by the `firebase/php-jwt` package was replaced with classes from the `lcobucci/jwt` package

- Class `Auth0\SDK\API\Header\Authorization\AuthorizationBearer` was changed to `Auth0\SDK\API\Header\AuthorizationBearer`
