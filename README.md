### Support Matrix

This library follows the [PHP release support schedule](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) and we do not support PHP versions after they leave their security support window. Developers are encouraged to ensure their environments remain up-to-date to continue receiving timely security fixes from PHP and SDK updates and support from Auth0.

The PHP and SDK version combinations listed below are supported through the indicated support timelines:

| SDK Version | PHP Runtime | [Support Concludes](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8           | 8.1         | Nov 2024                                                        |

## Documentation

- Quickstarts
  - [Web Application Authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/php/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-php-web-app))
  - [Backend API Authorization](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/php/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-php-api-samples))
- [SDK API Documentation](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-PHP/)

## Usage

### Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to create a [free Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup) and register an [Application](https://auth0.com/docs/applications).

### Installation

The supported method of SDK installation is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). From your terminal shell, `cd` into your project directory and issue the following command:

```bash
$ composer require auth0/auth0-php
```

You can find guidance on installing Composer [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your application must include the Composer autoloader, [as explained here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading), for the SDK to be usable within your application.

Next, you will want ensure your application has [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) compatible libraries installed. These are used for network requests. As an example, let's say you wish to use [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz) and [Nylom's PSR-7 implementation](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7), which include PSR-18 and PSR-17 factories, respectively:

```bash
$ composer require kriswallsmith/buzz nyholm/psr7
```

The libraries specified above are simply examples. Any libraries that support the PSR-18 and PSR-17 standards will work.

‚Üó [Guzzle 7 natively supports PSR-18.](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients/guzzle7-adapter.html)<br />
‚Üó [Guzzle 6 is compatible with an adaptor library.](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter)<br />

‚Üó [Search packagist for other PSR-18 HTTP client libraries.](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation)

### SDK Initialization

Begin by instantiating the SDK and passing the appropriate configuration options. Depending on your use case, you may need to configure more options during instantiation.

```PHP
<?php
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;

$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    // The values below are found in the Auth0 dashboard, under application settings:
    domain: '{{YOUR_TENANT}}.auth0.com',
    clientId: '{{YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}}'
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should **never** hard-code tokens or other sensitive configuration data in a real-world application. Consider using environment variables to store and pass these values to your application.

During configuration, you should pass instances of the PSR-18 and PSR-17 libraries your application is using:

```PHP
<?php
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;
use Buzz\Client\MultiCurl;
use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;

// PSR-17 HTTP Factory (creates http requests and responses)
$Psr17Library = new Psr17Factory();

 // PSR-18 HTTP Client (delivers http requests created by the PSR-17 factory above)
$Psr18Library = new MultiCurl($Psr17Library);

// Configure the Sdk using these libraries
$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    // üß© Other configuration options, such as those demonstrated above, here.

    // An instance of your PSR-18 HTTP Client library:
    httpClient: $Psr18Library,

    // Instances of your PSR-17 HTTP Client library:
    httpRequestFactory: $Psr17Library,
    httpResponseFactory: $Psr17Library,
    httpStreamFactory: $Psr17Library,
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

As mentioned in the [installation step](#installation), these are just examples: any PSR-18 or PSR-17 compatible libraries you choose to use in your application will be compatible here.

### Configuration Options

When configuring the SDK, you can instantiate `SdkConfiguration` and pass options as named arguments in PHP 8 (strongly recommended) or as an array. The [SDK Initialization step above](#sdk-initialization) uses named arguments. Another method of configuring the SDK is passing an array of key-values matching the argument names and values of the matching allowed types. For example:

```PHP
<?php
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;

$auth0 = new Auth0([
    'domain' => '{{YOUR_TENANT}}.auth0.com',
    'clientId' => '{{YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}}',
    'clientSecret' => '{{YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET}}',
]);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should **never** hard-code tokens or other sensitive configuration data in a real-world application. Consider using environment variables to store and pass these values to your application.

This method is discouraged because you lose out on type hinting but is helpful in PHP 7.4, where named arguments are not supported.

The following options are available for your configuration:

```text
$strategy              string|null                    Defaults to 'webapp'. Should be assigned either 'api', 'management', or 'webapp' to specify the type of application the SDK is being applied to. Determines what configuration options will be required at initialization.

### Configuration Strategies

The PHP SDK is a robust and flexible library capable of integration with many types of applications. You can define the style of application you're integrating the SDK with using the `strategy` configuration option, which controls what configuration options will be required at class instantiation to provide the best experience.

- `webapp`, the default configuration, will require `domain` and `clientId`. `clientSecret` is required when `tokenAlgorithm` is set to `HS256`. This is suitable for most application types.
- `api` indicates you'll be using the SDK in a stateless API-only environment; only `domain` and `audience` are required in this configuration.
- `management` is for stateless applications exclusively using Management API calls; `domain` is required. You must also provide either a `managementToken`, or assign `clientId` and `clientSecret` for the SDK to automatically aquire a token.

### Checking for an active session

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

// Auth0::getCredentials() returns either null if no session is active, or an object.
$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

if ($session !== null && !$session->accessTokenExpired) {
    // The user is signed in.
}
```

### Checking for an expired session

Important: After checking for an available session, you must ensure that session hasn't expired. This gives your app an opportunity to [renew the tokens](#renewing-tokens) or customize the handling behavior of your application's reauthentication flow, such as offering a customized intersitial page or error.

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

// Auth0::getCredentials() returns either null if no session is active, or an object.
$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

if ($session !== null && $session->accessTokenExpired) {
    // The user was signed in, but their token has expired.
    // See the "renewing tokens" section of this README for examples of using refresh tokens.
    // You could display a custom error here, or simply redirect the user back to your login route.
    // It's also a good opportunity to save any important app state data for the user before redirecting them.
    // However you choose to handle this, it's important to address this scenario.
}
```

### Authorizing User

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

// Is this end-user already signed in?
if ($session === null) {
    // They are not. Redirect the end user to the login page.
    header('Location: ' . $auth0->login());
    exit;
}
```

### Requesting Tokens

After a user successfully authenticates with Auth0 from the step above, they'll be returned to your application with the `state` and `code` URL parameters necessary to request a token. This is the last step in finalizing the user session.

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

// Is this end-user already signed in?
if ($session === null && isset($_GET['code']) && isset($_GET['state'])) {
    if ($auth0->exchange() === false) {
        die("Authentication failed.");
    }

    // Authentication complete!
    print_r($auth0->getUser());
}
```

### Logging out

When signing out an end-user from your application, it's important to use Auth0's /logout endpoint to sign them out properly:

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

if ($session) {
    // Clear the end-user's session, and redirect them to the Auth0 /logout endpoint.
    header('Location: ' . $auth0->logout());
    exit;
}
```

### Renewing tokens

Your application must request the `offline_access` scope to retrieve the Refresh Token necessary for this.

```PHP
<?php

/*
    üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Add the 'offline_access' scope during configuration to retrieve Refresh Tokens.
*/

$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

// Is this end-user already signed in?
if ($session === null) {
    // They are not. Redirect the end user to the login page.
    header('Location: ' . $auth0->login());
    exit;
}

// Is this end-user already signed in? If so, is their session expired?
if ($session->accessTokenExpired) {
    try {
        // Token has expired, attempt to renew it.
        $auth0->renew();
    } catch (StateException $e) {
        // There was an error trying to renew the token. Clear the session.
        $auth0->clear();

        // Prompt to login again.
        header('Location: ' . $auth0->login());
        exit;
    }
}
```

### Decoding an Id Token

In instances where you need to manually decode an Id Token, you can use the `Auth0::decode()` method:

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

try {
    $token = $auth0->decode('{{YOUR_ID_TOKEN}}');
} catch (\Auth0\SDK\Exception\InvalidTokenException $exception) {
    die("Unable to decode Id Token; " . $exception->getMessage());
}
```

### Decoding an Access Token

In instances where you need to manually decode an Access Token, such as a custom API backend you've built where an access token is provided by a frontend client, you can use the `Auth0::decode()` method:

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

try {
    $token = $auth0->decode('{{YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}}', null, null, null, null, null, null, \Auth0\SDK\Token::TYPE_TOKEN);
} catch (\Auth0\SDK\Exception\InvalidTokenException $exception) {
    die("Unable to decode Access Token; " . $exception->getMessage());
}
```

### Using the Authentication API

More advanced applications can access the SDK's full suite of authentication API methods using the `Auth0\SDK\API\Authentication` class:

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

// Start a passwordless login:
$authentication = $auth0->authentication()->emailPasswordlessStart(/* ...configuration */);
```

### Using the Management API

This SDK offers an interface for Auth0's Management API, which, to access, requires an Access Token that is explicitly issued for your tenant's Management API by specifying the corresponding Audience.

```PHP
<?php
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;

$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    // üß© Include other required configuration options, such as those outlined in the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

    // The process for retrieving an Access Token for Management API endpoints is described here:
    // https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-php/using-the-management-api-with-auth0-php
    managementToken: '{{YOUR_MANAGEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN}}'
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should **never** hard-code tokens or other sensitive configuration data in a real-world application. Consider using environment variables to store and pass these values to your application.

Once configured, use the `Auth0::management()` method to get a configured instance of the `Auth0\SDK\API\Management` class:

```PHP

// üß© Include the configuration code from the above example here.

// Request users from the /users Management API endpoint
$response = $auth0->management()->users()->getAll();

### Using Organizations

[Organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations) is a set of features that provide better support for developers who build and maintain SaaS and Business-to-Business (B2B) applications. Organizations are currently only available to customers on our Enterprise and Startup subscription plans.

#### Initializing the SDK with Organizations

Configure the SDK with your Organization ID:

```PHP
<?php
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;
use Auth0\SDK\Utility\HttpResponse;

$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    // üß© Include other required configuration options, such as those outlined in the 'SDK Initialization' step above here.

    // Found in your Auth0 dashboard, under your organization settings.
    // Note that this must be configured as an array.
    organization: [ '{{YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID}}' ]
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should **never** hard-code tokens or other sensitive configuration data in a real-world application. Consider using environment variables to store and pass these values to your application.

#### Logging in with an Organization

With the SDK initialized using your Organization Id, you can use the `Auth0::login()` method as you normally would. Methods throughout the SDK will use the Organization Id you configured in their API calls.

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'Initializing the SDK with Organizations' step above here.

$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

// Is this end-user already signed in?
if ($session === null) {
  // They are not. Redirect the end user to the login page.
  header('Location: ' . $auth0->login());
  exit;
}
```

#### Accepting user invitations

Auth0 Organizations allow users to be invited using emailed links, which will direct a user back to your application. The user will be sent to your application URL based on your configured `Application Login URI`, which you can change from your application's settings inside the Auth0 dashboard.

When the user arrives at your application using an invite link, three query parameters are available: `invitation`, `organization`, and `organization_name.` These will always be delivered using a GET request.

A helper function is provided to handle extracting these query parameters and automatically redirecting to the Universal Login page:

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'Initializing the SDK with Organizations' step above here.

$auth0->handleInvitation();
```

Suppose you prefer to have more control over this process. In that case, extract the relevant query parameters using `getInvitationParameters()`, and then initiate the Universal Login redirect yourself:

```PHP
<?php

// üß© Include the configuration code from the 'Initializing the SDK with Organizations' step above here.

// Returns an object containing the invitation query parameters, or null if they aren't present
if ($invite = $auth0->getInvitationParameters()) {
  // Does the invite organization match one of your configured organizations?
  if (in_array($invite['organization'], $configuration->getOrganization()) === false) {
    // It does not. Throw an error; for example:
    throw new Exception("This invitation isn't intended for this service. Please have your administrator check the service configuration and request a new invitation.");
  }

  // Redirect to Universal Login using the emailed invitation code and Organization Id
  header('Location: ' . $auth0->login(null, [
    'invitation' => $invite['invitation'],
    'organization' => $invite['organization'],
  ]));
}
```

After successful authentication via the Universal Login Page, the user will arrive back at your application using your configured `redirect_uri`, their token will be validated, and they will have an authenticated session. Use `Auth0::getCredentials()` to retrieve details about the authenticated user.

#### Validation guidance for supporting multiple organizations

In the examples above, our application is operating with a single, configured Organization. By initializing the SDK with the `organization` argument, we tell the internal token verifier to validate an `org_id` claim's presence and match what was provided.

In some cases, your application may need to support validating tokens' `org_id` claims for several different organizations. When initializing the SDK, the `organization` argument accepts an array of organizations; during token validation, if ANY of those Organization Ids match, the token passes validation. When generating links or issuing API calls, the first Organization Id in that configuration array will be used. You can alter this value at any time by updating your instance of the `SdkConfiguration` or passing custom parameters to methods that use Organization Ids.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have a more complex application with custom token validation code, you must validate the `org_id` claim on tokens to ensure the value received is expected and known by your application. If the claim is not valid, your application should reject the token. See [https://auth0.com/docs/organizations/using-tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations/using-tokens) for more information.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
- Add support for [passwordless](https://auth0.com/passwordless) and [multi-factor authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa).
- Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts) with the same user.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
