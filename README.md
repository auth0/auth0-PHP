## Documentation

We also have tailored SDKs for [Laravel](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0), [Symfony](https://github.com/auth0/symfony), and [WordPress](https://github.com/auth0/wordpress). If you are using one of these frameworks, use the tailored SDK for the best integration experience.

- Quickstarts
  - [Application using Sessions (Stateful)](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/php) — Demonstrates a traditional web application that uses sessions and supports logging in, logging out, and querying user profiles. [The completed source code is also available.](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-php-web-app)
  - [API using Access Tokens (Stateless)](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/php) — Demonstrates a backend API that authorizes endpoints using access tokens provided by a frontend client and returns JSON. [The completed source code is also available.](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-php-api-samples)
- [PHP Examples](./EXAMPLES.md) — Code samples for common scenarios.
- [Documentation Hub](https://www.auth0.com/docs) — Learn more about integrating Auth0 with your application.

## Getting Started

> Please review our [support policy](#support-policy) for details on our PHP version support.

### Installation

Ensure you have [the necessary dependencies](#requirements) installed, then add the SDK to your application using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require auth0/auth0-php
```

### Configure Auth0

Create a **Regular Web Application** in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). Verify that the "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" is set to `POST`.

Next, configure the callback and logout URLs for your application under the "Application URIs" section of the "Settings" page:

- **Allowed Callback URLs**: The URL of your application where Auth0 will redirect to during authentication, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
- **Allowed Logout URLs**: The URL of your application where Auth0 will redirect to after user logout, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/login`.

Note the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**. These values will be used later.

### Add login to your application

Create a `SdkConfiguration` instance configured with your Auth0 domain and Auth0 application client ID and secret. Generate a sufficiently long, random string for your `cookieSecret` using `openssl rand -hex 32`. Create a new `Auth0` instance and pass your configuration to it.

```php
use Auth0\SDK\Auth0;
use Auth0\SDK\Configuration\SdkConfiguration;

$configuration = new SdkConfiguration(
    domain: 'Your Auth0 domain',
    clientId: 'Your Auth0 application client ID',
    clientSecret: 'Your Auth0 application client secret',
    cookieSecret: 'Your generated string',
);

$auth0 = new Auth0($configuration);
```

Use the `getCredentials()` method to check if a user is authenticated.

```php
// getCredentials() returns null if the user is not authenticated.
$session = $auth0->getCredentials();

if (null === $session || $session->accessTokenExpired()) {
    // Redirect to Auth0 to authenticate the user.
    header('Location: ' . $auth0->login());
    exit;
}
```

Complete the authentication flow and obtain the tokens by calling `exchange()`:

```php
if (null !== $auth0->getExchangeParameters()) {
    $auth0->exchange();
}
```

Finally, you can use `getCredentials()?->user` to retrieve information about our authenticated user:

```php
print_r($auth0->getCredentials()?->user);
```

**That's it! You have successfully authenticated your first user with Auth0!** From here, you may want to try following along with [one of our quickstarts](#documentation) or browse through [our examples](./EXAMPLES.md) for additional insight and guidance.

If you have questions, the [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com/) is a fantastic resource to ask questions and get help.
